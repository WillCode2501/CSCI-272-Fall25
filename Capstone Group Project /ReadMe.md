Capstone Group Project: library management system
Members: Raakin, Sherry, Tejbir, Henry, Wei

Summary:
  The project we worked on together is called LibraVault, a functional library management system. The purpose of the program is to simulate how a real library might organize its data and perform everyday tasks, such as adding books, registering members, checking out books, returning books, and maintaining a history of all past transactions. We designed the system following the class standards, since one of the main goals of the assignment was to show that we understand concepts like encapsulation, composition, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling. 
  When the program starts, it automatically loads all the library’s data from the three .txt files, one for the members' accounts, one for transaction history, and one for the members' accounts. This means that the system does not start empty every time; instead, it continues from the last saved log, just like a real application. The Library class handles that process by calling loadData(), which uses the BookInfo, MemberAccount, and Transaction classes to read the files and rebuild all objects into vectors stored in memory.
  After loading the data, the user is required to log in. If the login matches one of the accounts in the member.txt file, the system automatically identifies whether the user is a staff or regular user based on the role stored in the file. Staff members get access to additional options, such as adding and removing books or adding new users, while regular users mainly have access to viewing books and checking them out or returning them. This difference in permissions connects directly to the inheritance and polymorphism concepts implemented in this project.
  Once a user is logged in, the program displays a menu with all the available actions. Each option connects to a specific function inside the Library class, so the user interface is kept simple. For example, checking out a book creates a new transaction object, updates the number of available copies in the corresponding BookInfo object, and saves the new state to the transaction file. Returning a book updates immediately both the book's availability and the transaction's return date, and also the status. Also, our program keeps everything synchronized, so the date shown to the user is always accurate.
  Another important part of the design is the structure of the files. We divided the system into separate ones like, for example, BookInfo, MemberAccount, Transaction, and Library, so that each one has a specific job. The Library class acts like the brain of the whole system, coordinating the interaction between books, members, and transactions, while the other files focus on storing data and providing the functions needed to update that data.

Purpose:
Understanding the usage of headers and cpp files, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, menu-driven system, data storage, functions, pointers, string manipulation, exception handling, template, and everything else learned in C++ object orienating programming.

Comments:
Some fixed are needed for improvement, will work on it as a side project solo in the future.
